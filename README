Hidden Reputations
==================

Exposes hidden reputation meters in the reputation tab, such as
Alliance/Horde or Steamwheedle Cartel.


Description
===========

This addon exposes hidden reputation meters in the reputation tab in World
of Warcraft. The following factions are known to have hidden reputations:

Classic:
 * Alliance (for Alliance players)
 * Horde (for Horde players)
 * Steamwheedle Cartel

The Burning Crusade:
 * Shattrath City

Wrath of the Lich King:
 * Sholazar Basin

Similarly to Alliance Vanguard and Horde Expedition, these factions gain a
portion of the reputation gained by their sub-factions.

These reputations have no known purpose in the game.


Configuration
=============

There are no configuration options.


Known issues
============

 * Due to quirks of the API, these reputations are only displayed if their
   value is non-zero. This should be of little practical significance.

 * The reputation bars are too long. This is a bug in the client, which is
   also visible with Alliance Vanguard and Horde Expedition.
